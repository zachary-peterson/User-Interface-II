            <h2> Hey! I'm Zach</h2>
            <p>I started coding back in 2015 with a twelve week Front End Web Dev course from General Assembly.</p>
            <p>But to be honest, was really disappointed becuase a lot of the skills I learned had already been self-taught, and there was no real system of accountability.</p>
            <p>So! I decided to start a business in something I knew, real estate and fixing up houses.</p>
            <p>I learned a lot, but overall fell into the trap of just trying to get by (houses are expensive). Sold a majority of my property, and practiced a little code here and there.</p>
            <p>I decided in 2019 that I wanted to see more of the world and set-out with the plan of seeing as many countries as I could over a six month period.</p>
            <p>After leaving the US, I arrived in New Zealand, where I was supposed to be for two weeks.</p>
            <p>Three months later, I hadn't left New Zealand, and becasue of a soon to expire passport, couldn't apply for a work visa.</p>
            <p>But, it all worked out, because I now know where my future forever home will be.</p>
            <p>I decided to get back in to coding because it's a skill set that can be used anywhere, and I hope to eventually find something sustainable there!</p>
